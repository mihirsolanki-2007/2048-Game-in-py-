We will design each logic function such as we are performing a left swipe then we will use it for right swipe by reversing matrix and performing left swipe.
Moving up can be done by taking transpose then moving left.
Moving down can be done by taking transpose the moving right.
All the logic in the program are explained in detail in the comments. Highly recommended to go through all the comments.



We have two python files below, one is 2048.py which contains main driver code and the other is logic.py which contains all functions used. logic.py should be imported in 2048.py to use these functions. just place both the files in the same folder then run 2048.py will work perfectly.
